# This file is used to generate the sasl mapping db for the relay server.
# To prevent the password from being stored in the source code,
# we only store/use the hashed db version.
# To update the service/user/password, update the row below with the appropriate info.
# Then copy it to the running container as /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd, and run
#   postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
# and make sure the /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db file is generated, and use that one as
# the sasl mapping db file. (Once you've changed the db file you most likely want to copy
# it from the container and store it in source control - do not store this one with the
# real password!)
