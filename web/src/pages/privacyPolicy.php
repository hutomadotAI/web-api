                            Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the
                            site, how you got here and what
                            you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site
                            and is not tied to personally
                            identifiable information.We therefore do not collect or store your personal information
                            (e.g. your name or address) so this
                            information cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>
