            The goals of the training program should relate directly to the needs determined by the assessment process outlined above.
            Course objectives should clearly state what behavior or skill will be changed as a result of the training and should relate
            to the mission and strategic plan of the company. Goals should include milestones to help take the employee from where he or
            she is today to where the firm wants him or her in the future. Setting goals helps to evaluate the training program and also
            to motivate employees. Allowing employees to participate in setting goals increases the probability of success.
